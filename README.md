##  Project Overview

This project showcases a computer vision application using FastAPI and Uvicorn. You'll find a well-organized structure featuring both backend and frontend components for interactive visual processing.

###  Features

- 🧠 **API-powered backend**: Built with FastAPI for efficient and scalable endpoints.
- 🌐 **Interactive frontend**: Web interface (likely React or another JS framework) for seamless user experience.
- 🖼️ **Vision tools**: Includes tools for image processing, detection, or analysis (update based on actual implementation).

## Development Tips

* **Live Reloading**: The `--reload` option in Uvicorn allows automatic restarts on code changes—perfect for development!
* **Editable Install (`-e`)**: Makes your local edits instantly reflected in the environment.
* **Structure Insights**: You’ll typically find:
* A backend folder (e.g., `app/`)
* A frontend folder (e.g., `frontend/`)
* `setup.py`, `requirements.txt` for managing dependencies
* `.gitignore`, `vercel.json`, etc., for deployment and configuration
